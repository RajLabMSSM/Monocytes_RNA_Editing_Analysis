# Monocytes_RNA_Editing_Analysis-

There is no any kind of external data file ( tsv/meta/Rdata/..) included in this repository. All required data to run the code/pipeline are in minerva. 

### Differential Editing rate
* Basal Monocytes (PD vs Control cases) - Rmd and html avaliable, no other files. 
* Stimulated Monocytes (LPS vs Basal / IFNb vs Basal) - Rmd and html avaliable, no other files. 


### Differential Gene expression 
* Basal Monocytes (PD vs Control cases) - Rmd and html avaliable, no other files. 
* Stimulated Monocytes (LPS vs Basal / IFNb vs Basal) - Rmd and html avaliable, no other files.
